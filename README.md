  ## Installation
  First clone the repo to your computer then once opened run "npm i" in the terminal. Next create a ".env" file using the .env.EXAMPLE to help get you started. In your ".env" file for "DB_USER" type "root" and for "DB_PASSWORD" type your MySql Password. Once you have done that you can type "mysql -u root -p where you will then be required to enter your MySql password once again. When you have done that you will be able to type "source "db/schema.sql" and press enter drom there you can type quit to get out of the mysql terminal. You can now go back in to the terminal and type "npm run seed" to seed the database you have just created and when that had finished you can enter "npm run start" which will start the local deployemnt. from there you can use postman or insomnia to test the code.

  ## Usage
  On postman or insomnia you can use the CREATE, GET, PUT or DELETE method for the "http://localhost:3001/api" /categories /products or /tags routes. See video below for further guidance.
